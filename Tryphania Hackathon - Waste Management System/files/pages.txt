   - **Organization Registration**: Enable organizations (such as charities, shelters, or NGOs) to register with additional information like their location, contact details, and mission statement.

3. **Donation Process**:
   - **Create a Donation Listing**: Donators can list the excess food they have available. Include fields for food type, quantity, expiry date, and pick-up location.
